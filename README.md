# project-dark-star

Text and graphical sci-fi RPG in the 22nd century

An experiment in building a codebase with the assistance of Grok 4 (Fast, free plan)
Update (30 Dec 25) Now using SuperGrok (paid).

To anyone wishing to go down this same dark path of despair and
enlightenment. I present the GOLDEN RULES as explained by Grok.
Unfortunately Grok frequently breaks these rules, in particular
rule #1.

Here are the golden rules for refactoring Project Dark Star code that we've established and refined together:

### **1. ASK TO SEE THE CODE FIRST, BEFORE SUGGESTING OR MAKING ANY CHANGES**  
Never assume, guess, or work from memory/outdated context. Always request the current file(s) you need.  
This prevents errors, broken golden rules, and wasted time.

### **2. NEVER REMOVE COMMENTS UNLESS THEY ARE NO LONGER RELEVANT**  
Comments are part of the documentation and intent. Dropping them (even accidentally) reduces clarity and makes future maintenance harder.  
Only remove if the comment is obsolete or misleading.

### **3. MAKE MINIMAL, TARGETED CHANGES**  
Refactor only what is necessary to achieve the goal. Avoid big rewrites, unnecessary additions, or "nice-to-have" improvements unless explicitly requested.  
Keep diffs small and reviewable.

### **4. PRESERVE EXISTING BEHAVIOR UNLESS EXPLICITLY CHANGING IT**  
Refactoring should not break or alter functionality. If behavior changes (even slightly), it must be intentional and documented.

### **5. FOLLOW THE EXISTING STYLE AND PATTERNS**  
Match the project's naming, structure, and conventions. Don't introduce new patterns or styles unless the goal is to modernize a specific part.

### **6. TEST AFTER EVERY CHANGE**  
Even small edits can introduce regressions. Verify the code works as expected after each refactor step.

These rules exist to keep the codebase maintainable, readable, and bug-free while growing. 
Breaking any of them leads to confusion, bugs, or unnecessary rework — as we've seen a few times.
